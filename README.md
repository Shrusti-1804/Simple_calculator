# Simple_calculator

This is a basic calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using functions in C programming.

To use the calculator, simply compile and run the program in your C development environment. You will be prompted to enter two numbers, followed by the operation you would like to perform (e.g. + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division). The result will be displayed on the screen

This calculator was built as a simple exercise to demonstrate the use of functions in C programming.
